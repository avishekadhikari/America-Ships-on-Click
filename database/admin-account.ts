/**
 * Administrator credential provisioning.
 *
 * Public signup cannot mint an administrator any more — the route refuses the
 * role and migration 0012 refuses the row — so the account has to come from
 * somewhere an operator controls. That somewhere is this module: set
 * ADMIN_PASSWORD in the environment and the account named by ADMIN_EMAIL is
 * created with it, or has its password brought in line with it, every time the
 * server starts.
 *
 * This runs on the owner connection, alongside migrations, for the same reason
 * seeding does: the runtime role is not allowed to write an admin row, which
 * is precisely the property being relied on.
