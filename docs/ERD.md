# Entity Relationship Diagram — America Ships On Click

The schema is the product rules, not a sketch of them. Open Books arithmetic,
double-booking, admin self-serve, the 30-day sell lock, the 1×/5× holder split,
and the 0.7% holder cap are all CHECK constraints or triggers. A route that
forgets a rule still cannot write a row that breaks it.

Spec locked 2026-09-10. Phase 1 tables (webhook, wallets, stake, hourly bonus)
are live in the database. Phase 2 haul receipts exist as empty, constrained
tables. Messaging and email are not in this database yet.

## Domains

| Domain | Tables | What the database decides |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Identity | `users`, `driver_profiles`, `shipper_profiles`, `driver_documents`, `driver_equipment`, `driver_payment_accounts`, `verification_reviews` | Who may act. Admin cannot be self-served. A carrier cannot mark themselves verified. |
| Freight | `loads`, `bookings`, `load_events`, `load_offers` | One live booking per load. Illegal status jumps are rejected. Offers accept atomically. |
| Open Books | `settlements`, `settlement_disputes`, `settlement_adjustments`, `platform_config` | `net = gross − fee − fuel − factor`. Settlements are append-only. Corrections are additive. |
| Ops | `refresh_tokens`, `password_reset_tokens`, `idempotency_keys`, `api_rate_limits`, `auth_login_attempts`, `audit_log`, `notifications`, `notification_preferences`, `ratings`, `vvip_leads` | Sessions, throttles, and reputation survive restarts. VVIP leads are append-only. |
| Phase 1 token | `wallets`, `chain_contracts`, `webhook_receipts`, `contract_events`, `token_buys`, `token_positions`, `app_memberships`, `premium_attestations`, `hourly_epochs`, `transaction_reserves`, `hourly_claims`, `driver_payouts` | Buy-in, 30-day lock, 1× vs 5× never stacked, holder claims cannot exceed 7% of the 10% reserve. Driver payouts are USDC on Base only. |
| Phase 2 (empty) | `haul_receipts` | Same receipt will carry plate, load id, miles, rate, reserve. Nothing writes it yet. |

## Money split (holder rewards)

Per unit of volume the database will accept:

| Slice | Share of volume | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Transaction reserve | 10% | `reserve_amount = volume × 0.10` |
| Holder pool (from that reserve) | 0.7% of volume | `holder_slice = reserve_amount × 0.07` — the only money hourly claims may draw |
| Remainder of reserve | 9.3% of volume | Not a holder reward. Not mixed into driver USDC payouts. |
| Open Books platform fee | 5% of gross | Separate pipe. Unchanged. `settlements.fee_pct_applied`. |
| Driver payout | settlement net | USDC on Base. `driver_payouts`. Never the holder pool. |

Hourly bonus weights: regular = 1× staked balance, premium = 5× instead (never 6×). If the sum of naive claims exceeds that hour's `holder_pool`, each claim is multiplied by `haircut_ratio ≤ 1`. The insert trigger refuses any claim that would push `sum(paid_amount)` over the pool.

## Views

| View | Scope | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `public_ledger_view` | Public | Settlements joined to lanes, no identities |
| `settlement_totals_view` | Public | Real aggregates, never counters |
| `settlement_effective_view` | Public | Original net plus adjustments |
| `public_shipper_view` | Public | Company name only, so the board can join past billing RLS |
| `driver_reputation_view` / `shipper_reputation_view` | Public aggregates | Scores without rater identity |
| `driver_earnings_view` / `shipper_spend_view` | Self-scoping | Identity filter lives in the view |
| `lane_rate_stats_view` | Public, n ≥ 3 | Lane pricing that cannot dox a thin shipper |
| `load_board_stats_view` | Public | Open / booked / in-transit counts |
| `hourly_epoch_view` | Public | Holder pool vs paid vs unclaimed |
| `wallet_holder_view` | Self-scoping | Stake, lock, 1×/5× for the caller |

## Append-only tables

`settlements`, `audit_log`, `load_events`, `verification_reviews`, `settlement_adjustments`, `vvip_leads`, `webhook_receipts`, `contract_events`, `token_buys`, `transaction_reserves`, `hourly_claims`, `haul_receipts`.

`UPDATE` and `DELETE` are refused by trigger even for the table owner.
