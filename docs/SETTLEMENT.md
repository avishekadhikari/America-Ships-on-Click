# Settlement — how a load becomes money

Every number the public ledger publishes is decided in one place: the
`PATCH /api/bookings/:id/complete` transaction in
[`backend/routes.ts:504`](../backend/routes.ts). Nothing the browser sends
is trusted to price a load. The request body for that endpoint is empty — the
route reads the booking, the load, and the current rates for itself, computes
gross, fee, fuel, factor, and net, and writes a settlement row that the database
then refuses to let anyone change. A driver can no more talk the server into a
larger payout than a shipper can talk it into a smaller one, because neither of
them is asked.

## The four numbers

A settlement is four subtractions off one product:

```
gross  = miles x rate_per_mile
fee    = gross x fee_pct                 platform's cut
fuel   = miles x fuel_rate_per_mile      modeled cost of running the lane
factor = gross x factor_pct  (or 0)      cost of same-day funding
net    = gross - fee - fuel - factor     what the carrier takes home
```

Fee and factor scale with the money; fuel scales with the distance. That
distinction matters more than it looks, and it is where the previews go wrong —
see [What the estimates leave out](#what-the-estimates-leave-out).

## Where the rates come from

`fee_pct` (0.05), `factor_pct` (0.03), `fuel_rate_per_mile` (0.45), and
`broker_comparison_pct` (0.20) are rows in `platform_config`, seeded by
[`0001_initial_schema.sql:171`](../database/migrations/0001_initial_schema.sql).
They are not constants in code, not environment variables, and not duplicated
per load. Changing the platform fee is an `UPDATE` against one row.

Both the server and the browser read them from the same table — the browser via
`GET /api/config` ([`routes.ts:90`](../backend/routes.ts)), the settlement
path via a direct `SELECT` inside its own transaction
([`routes.ts:538`](../backend/routes.ts)). Every read site carries the same
`?? 0.05` / `?? 0.03` / `?? 0.45` fallbacks, so a missing config row degrades to
the seeded defaults instead of writing `NaN` into the ledger. The fallbacks are
written out four times across `routes.ts`, `seed.ts`, `FindLoads.tsx`, and
`PostLoad.tsx`; they agree today, and nothing enforces that they keep agreeing.

`broker_comparison_pct` is the one rate with no consumer. It is seeded, exposed
by `/api/config`, and typed in `PlatformConfig`, but no page reads it — it exists
for the "20% broker vs 5% us" comparison the marketing copy makes by hand.

## Rates are copied onto the row, not referenced

`settlements` stores `fee_pct_applied` and `fuel_rate_per_mile` alongside the
dollar amounts. This is deliberate duplication. If the ledger stored only dollar
figures and the platform later moved the fee to 6%, every historical row would
still be correct but unexplainable; if it stored a foreign key to
`platform_config`, raising the fee would silently rewrite the past — a load
settled in March would start displaying June's percentage.

Copying the rate in at settlement time means a row carries its own justification.
`gross_amount`, `fee_amount`, and `fee_pct_applied` together are checkable
arithmetic three years later, with no knowledge of what the platform charges
now.

## Who decides the factor cost

Same-day funding is offered by the shipper and opted into by the driver, and at
settlement the driver's standing preference wins:

```ts
const factored = drvPayRes.rows[0]?.same_day_funding_opt_in
              ?? load.same_day_funding_offered;
```

The load's `same_day_funding_offered` flag is a fallback for drivers with no
`driver_payment_accounts` row — not a veto and not a requirement. A driver who
opted into quick pay is factored even on a load that did not advertise it, and a
driver who did not is not factored on a load that did. That is the right default
for the carrier, whose cash-flow needs do not change lane by lane, but it means
the shipper's own preview of the factor line is a guess about someone else's
settings.

## What the estimates leave out

Three places in the product show a carrier's take-home, and only one of them is
the ledger:

| Where | Formula | 780 mi @ $2.15 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Load board card ([`FindLoads.tsx:169`](../frontend/src/pages/FindLoads.tsx)) | `gross - fee` | **$1,593.15** |
| Post-a-load calculator ([`PostLoad.tsx:43`](../frontend/src/pages/PostLoad.tsx)) | `gross - fee - factor` | **$1,593.15** (or $1,542.84 with quick pay) |
| Settlement ([`routes.ts:555`](../backend/routes.ts)) | `gross - fee - fuel - factor` | **$1,242.15** (or $1,191.84 factored) |

Neither preview subtracts fuel. On that lane the gap is $351.00 — 22% of the
figure on the board card, and more than four times the platform fee the card
draws attention to. A driver books expecting $1,593 and settles at $1,242.

This is a presentation gap, not a math bug: the ledger row is right, the board
card is answering a narrower question ("what does the platform keep?") with a
label that reads like the broader one ("take-home pay"). Whether fuel belongs in
a driver-facing estimate is a product decision — a carrier who runs a
$0.38/mile truck is not losing $0.45/mile — but the two figures should not both
be called take-home. The calculator's copy also promises the 5% fee is the whole
story, which the settled row contradicts by three times that amount.

## The database's own opinion of the arithmetic

Application code can be wrong. `settlements_math_balances`
([`0002_security.sql:143`](../database/migrations/0002_security.sql)) makes the
wrong answer unwritable:

```sql
CHECK (
  abs(net_amount - (gross_amount - fee_amount - fuel_cost - factor_cost)) < 0.01
  AND abs(gross_amount - (miles * rate_per_mile)) < 0.01
)
```

A settlement whose net does not follow from its own components is rejected —
including one written by the owner role, by a migration, or by hand in `psql`.
Alongside it, `settlements_non_negative` refuses negative money and
`settlements_fee_pct_sane` caps the applied fee at 50%, so a stray decimal
cannot mint a row claiming the platform took 500%.

The one-cent tolerance exists because the math is done in JavaScript doubles and
compared against Postgres `NUMERIC`. It is a rounding allowance, not a fudge
factor — nothing legitimate lands inside it, and a mistyped formula misses by
dollars.

## Amounts are stored unrounded

Nothing rounds to cents before the `INSERT`. `780 * 2.15 * 0.05` is
`83.85000000000001` in IEEE 754, and the columns are unconstrained `NUMERIC`, so
that is what the ledger holds. Every display path applies `.toFixed(2)`, so it
is invisible in the UI and in the CSV export, and the balance CHECK tolerates it
by design. It surfaces in two places: raw `SELECT`s against `settlements`, and
`settlement_totals_view`, where the residue sums across every row. Rounding each
component to cents at write time would remove it, at the cost of a migration for
existing rows.

## Exactly one driver, exactly one settlement

The money math only makes sense if a load is hauled once. Booking
([`routes.ts:419`](../backend/routes.ts)) defends that three times over,
inside a single transaction on a single pooled connection — which is the point of
`db.transaction()`, since `FOR UPDATE` holds its lock only for statements issued
on the same client, and a `BEGIN` on a shared pool handle would not be atomic at
all:

1. An unlocked read separates "no such load" (404) from "already taken" (409), so
   a losing driver gets an accurate answer rather than a generic one.
2. `SELECT ... WHERE status = 'open' FOR UPDATE` blocks behind any competing
   booking and re-checks the status afterward. Exactly one caller leaves that
   line holding the row.
3. A partial unique index, `idx_unique_active_booking ON bookings (load_id)
   WHERE status NOT IN ('cancelled')`
   ([`0001_initial_schema.sql:143`](../database/migrations/0001_initial_schema.sql)),
   makes a second live booking unrepresentable even if both application checks
   were removed. The `23505` handler turns it back into the same 409. Cancelled
   bookings are excluded, so a released load can be booked again.

Completion is guarded the same way. The booking row is taken `FOR UPDATE`, only
the booked driver or an admin may trigger it, an already-completed booking is
refused, and the settlement `INSERT` plus both parent status updates commit
together. A settlement for a booking that was never marked completed cannot
exist, and neither can the reverse.

The SSE broadcast fires *after* `COMMIT`
([`routes.ts:579`](../backend/routes.ts)). Open Books subscribers therefore
never see a settlement that a rollback later erased.

## Written once, then frozen

`settlements` is append-only: the `settlements_append_only` trigger
([`0002_security.sql:243`](../database/migrations/0002_security.sql)) raises on
`UPDATE` and `DELETE` for every role, owner included, and the application role
holds only `SELECT, INSERT`. Both parents are `ON DELETE RESTRICT`, so the load
and booking a settlement refers to cannot be deleted out from under it. Every
write is recorded in `audit_log` by a `SECURITY DEFINER` trigger the application
can neither forge nor read back.

A published payout is a claim the platform cannot quietly retract. Correcting one
means writing a new row, not editing the old one.

## Totals are queried, never counted

The headline figures come from `settlement_totals_view`, a plain (not
materialized) aggregate over `settlements`, read at
[`routes.ts:615`](../backend/routes.ts). Nothing increments a counter
anywhere, so no cache can drift from the rows and no missed SSE event can leave a
stale total on a dashboard. Every read is the sum as of that instant; the cost is
a full aggregate per request, which is fine at ledger sizes and would want a
materialized view long before it stopped being.

The public ledger itself is `public_ledger_view`, which joins settlements to
loads for lane and equipment and stops there — no driver id, no shipper id, no
company name. Open Books publishes what a lane paid, not who hauled it.
